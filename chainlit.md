# Welcome to to Palm2Vn! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

`Hi there, Developer! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board. Chainlit is a powerful tool designed to help you prototype, debug and share applications built on top of LLMs.` - *Word from chainlit developer*

## Technology used ðŸ”—

- **Chainlit:** Chainlit is used to built entire website UI plus it also provided cloud storage for chat history and user authentification [Chainlit Documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io) ðŸ“š.
- **Langchain:** Library used to enhance chat model power, it also provide a lot useful tool [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) .
- **Google Palm API:** Powerfull chat model from google. [PalmAPI](https://developers.generativeai.google/guide/palm_api_overview) It excels at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation better than our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM. It can accomplish these tasks because of the way it was built â€“ bringing together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture improvements. 


## Usage

I want to create a chatbot that can `chat, process files, analyze image,etc,....` But for now, it can only chat. In the future, i'll try to make it can do more than just that.
